## Our Motivation

We at Unit 214 GmbH prioritize environmental sustainability, evident in our efforts to minimize carbon emissions.
Using ‚Ç¨ and CO<sub>2</sub>e kg conversion metrics, this report outlines our CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions for 2022, totaling 19.870 kg, and underscores our commitment to lowering our carbon footprint.
In this report, we focus on the larger emission items and acknowledge other categories contributing approximately 2.500 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e.

## Our Emissions

### Electrical Equipment (7.094 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e)

Establishing the company required new equipment purchases.
While we reused some items from previous work, additional modern equipment was essential.
We focused on vendors with minimal environmental impact.

### Furniture (2.931 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e)

Our investment in ergonomic furniture prioritized long-term sustainability and employee health, despite the initial increase in CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions.

### Hotel Stays and Travel

CO<sub>2</sub>e Emissions: üöÖ 939 kg, üöô 354 kg, ‚úàÔ∏è 1.594 kg, üè® 1.636 kg

Travel to clients, conferences, and team events necessitated a mix of comfort and sustainability.
We traveled 10 times more by train than plane, significantly reducing our carbon footprint.
Efforts are underway to eliminate flights, with existing air travel emissions being offset and charged to clients.

### Benefits & Team Events (2.793 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e)

Employee benefits such as meal expenses and tax-free vouchers, mainly for grocery shopping, contributed significantly to our CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions.
Our quarterly team events also added to this, as sourcing local, sustainable food and event options remains challenging.
We are actively working on improvements in this area.

## Conclusion

Our 2022 report, revealing emissions of 19.870 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e, highlights our dedication to environmental accountability, exemplified by our choice to offset our impact via Atmosfair twofold.
It highlights areas for improvement and our transparent approach to sustainability.
With a team of three employees and one working student, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and prioritizing environmental care, even as our business grows.
