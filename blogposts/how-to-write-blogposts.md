## Filename & `postId`

- New blogposts should be placed under `website-new/blogposts/`
- Each file represents one blogpost
- The file has to be named `{postId}.md` in order to be recognized by the Markdown renderer
- The `postId` will also be used as an url segment for the link to the post: `unit214.de/blog/{postId}`. Therefore,
  - use a meaningful name
  - use Kebab Case for the `postId`, e.g. `how-to-write-blogposts.md`
- After creating a new file or renaming an existing file, please restart the dev server. After changing something in the file, reloading the page is sufficient.

## Metadata

Every blogpost requires a frontmatter, containing its metadata:

```
---
title: 'How to write blogposts'
date: '2024-02-01'
tags: ['Unit 214', 'Blog', 'Tutorial']
author: 'Timo'
---

// file content
```

- The metadata will be displayed at the top of every blogpost and its styling is uniform throughout all blogposts.
- **All fields are required**
- All blogposts will be sorted by their dates. A click on "Next blogpost" reveals the next recent blogpost. A click on "Previous blogpost" reveals the most previous blogpost.
  - If you have multiple blogposts on the same day you can use a more specific date string with time (e.g. `2024-01-02T12:00:00`) to sort them.

## Content

- After the required metadata on the top, the post content will be rendered.
- Hereby you are free to create your own structure and styling using Markdown. The Markdown renderer supports [GitHub flavoured markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) meaning that everything that works on GitHub should also work here.
- As the title of the blogpost defined in the metadata is rendered as a `<h1>` element, consider starting with h2 (`##`) in your content (not mandatory).
- Headline links used as anchor links (e.g. for TOC) are autogenerated during render process. Its normally the headline name in Kepab Case.
- You can write the markdown file with the editor of your choice but its recommended to render it once using the dev server of the website (see [README.md](https://github.com/unit214/website-new?tab=readme-ov-file#unit-214-website-new)) to check if everything looks as intended.w

# GitHub Flavoured Markdown Cheatsheet

To help you write your blogpost you can find a Markdown Cheatsheet in the following:

## Headers

```
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
```

# H1

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

# Alt-H1

## Alt-H2

## Emphasis

```
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Links

```
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to another blogpost](/blog/example-1)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
www.example.com, https://example.com, and contact@example.com.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org

## Images

```
Here's our logo (hover to see the title text), taken from the public folder of the repo:

Inline-style:
![alt text](/blogposts/unit214.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: /blogposts/unit214.jpg "Logo Title Text 2"

To change an images size use the `<img>` element:
<img src="/blogposts/unit214.jpg" width="200" height="100"></img>

You can also use external links as images:
![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)
![Stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg "The Stormtroopocat")

Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax

![Alt text][id]

With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:

[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg  "The Dojocat"
```

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

## Tables

```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

## Blockquotes

```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...

## YouTube Videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE" target="_blank">
    <img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" />
</a>
```

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
