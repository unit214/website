## <span style={{ color: '#10AABF' }}>Our Motivation</span>

At Unit 214 GmbH, we prioritize environmental sustainability, as evident in our efforts to minimize carbon emissions.
Using euros and CO<sub>2</sub>e kg conversion metrics, this report outlines our CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions for 2023, totaling 17.310 kg, and underscores our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint.
Compared to [2022](https://unit214.de/blog/climate-transparency-report-2022) we lowered our overall carbon footprint by 2.560 kg.
In this report, we focus on the major emission items and acknowledge additional categories contributing approximately 3.484 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e.
The main categories are:

## <span style={{ color: '#F489A0' }}>Electrical Equipment (8.603 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e)</span>

In 2022, we purchased new electronics but also utilized existing private equipment.
In 2023, upon hiring our first full-time employee, we acquired a new set of electronics and transferred our private equipment to the company, both added to our CO<sub>2</sub>e footprint.

## <span style={{ color: '#F489A0' }}>Furniture (2.215 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e)</span>

In 2023, as we moved into our first office, we decided to purchase high-end furniture that will provide long-lasting ergonomics and comfort for our employees.
We have also included the CO<sub>2</sub>e footprint of our office itself in this category.

## <span style={{ color: '#F489A0' }}>Hotel Stays and Travel</span>

CO<sub>2</sub>e Emissions: üöÖ 249 kg, üöô 70 kg, ‚úàÔ∏è -- kg, üè® 118 kg

Travel to clients, conferences, and team events necessitated a mix of comfort and sustainability.
In 2023, we did not book a single flight and were able to reduce our travel significantly.
In total, we reduced our travel impact by over 90%.

## <span style={{ color: '#F489A0' }}>Benefits & Team Events (2.050 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e)</span>

Employee benefits, including meal expenses and tax-free grocery vouchers, significantly increased our CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions, as did our quarterly team events, given the difficulty of sourcing local, sustainable options.
We are focusing on improvements and have reduced our emissions by 700 kg since 2022, primarily through more sustainable team events.

## <span style={{ color: '#F489A0' }}>Conclusion</span>

Our 2023 report, revealing emissions of 17.310 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e, highlights our dedication to environmental accountability, exemplified by our choice to offset our impact via Atmosfair twofold.
It highlights areas for improvement and our transparent approach to sustainability.
With a team of four employees, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and prioritizing environmental care, even as our business grows.
